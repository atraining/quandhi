  <dt>API [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/api/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>Application Programming Interface. For data, this is usually a way provided by the data <a href="terms/publisher/">publisher</a> for programs or <a href="terms/app-application/">apps</a> to read data directly over the <a href="terms/web/">web</a>. The app sends the API a <a href="terms/query/">query</a> asking for the specific data it needs, e.g. the time of the next bus leaving a particular stop. This allows the app to use the data without downloading the whole dataset, saving <a href="terms/bandwidth/">bandwidth</a> and ensuring that the data used is the most up-to-date available.</p>

  <dt>Anonymisation [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/anonymisation/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>Processing data that includes personal information so that individuals can no longer be identified in the resulting data. Anonymisation enables data to be published without breaching <a href="terms/data-protection-legislation/">data protection</a> principles. The principal techniques are aggregation and <a href="terms/de-identification/">de-identification</a>. Care must be taken to avoid <a href="terms/data-leakage/">data leakage</a> that would result in individuals’ <a href="terms/privacy/">privacy</a> being compromised. UKAN studies best practice in data anonymisation.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Anonymization [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/anonymization/">Permalink</a>]</dt>

</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>App / Application [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/app-application/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>A piece of software (short for ‘application’), especially one designed to run on the <a href="terms/web/">web</a> or on mobile phones and similar platforms. Apps can make network connections to large databases and thus be a powerful way of consuming open data, which may be real-time, personalised, and (using a mobile phone’s <a href="terms/gps/">GPS</a>) location-specific information. <a href="terms/crowdsourcing/">Crowdsourcing</a> apps can also be used to build or improve datasets.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  
  
  <dt>Application Programming Interface [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/application-programming-interface/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>A way computer programs talk to one another. Can be understood in terms of how a programmer sends instructions between programs.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Attribution [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/attribution/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>Acknowledging the source of data when using or re-publishing it. A data <a href="terms/licence/">licence</a> permitting the data to be used may include a requirement to attribute the source. Data subject to this restriction may still be considered <a href="terms/open-data/">open data</a> according to the <a href="terms/open-definition/">Open Definition</a>.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Bandwidth [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/bandwidth/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>The rate at which data can be transferred between computers. As bandwidth is limited, <a href="terms/app-application/">apps</a> aim to download only the minimum amount of data needed to fulfil a user’s request.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Big Data [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/big-data/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>A collection of data so large that it cannot be stored, transmitted or processed by traditional means. The increasing availability of and need to process such datasets (for example, huge collections of weather or other scientific data) has led to the development of specialised computer technologies, architectures and programming languages.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>BitTorrent [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/bittorrent/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>BitTorrent is a protocol for distributing the bandwith for transferring very large files between the computers which are participating in the transfer. Rather than downloading a file from a specific source, BitTorrent allows peers to download from each other.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Bulk [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/bulk/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>Data is available in bulk if the entire dataset can be downloaded easily and efficiently to a user’s own system. Conversely it is non-bulk if one is limited to getting small parts of the dataset, for example, are you restricted to a few elements of the data at a time and therefore require thousands or millions of requests to get the entire dataset. The provision of bulk access is a requirement of <a href="terms/open-data/">open data</a>.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>CKAN [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/ckan/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>An <a href="terms/open-source/">open-source</a> software platform for creating <a href="terms/data-portal/">data portals</a>, built and maintained by Open Knowledge. CKAN is used as the official data-publishing platform of around 20 national governments and powers many more local, community, scientific and other data portals. Notable features are configurable <a href="terms/metadata/">metadata</a>, user-friendly web interface for publishers and data users, data preview, organisation-based authorisation levels, and <a href="terms/api/">APIs</a> giving access to all features as well as data access.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>CSV [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/csv/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>‘Comma-separated values’, a standard format for spreadsheet data. Data is represented in a plain text file, with each data row on a new line and commas separating the values on each row. As a very simple <a href="terms/open-format/">open format</a> it is easy to consume and is widely used for publishing open data.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Citizen Engagement [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/citizen-engagement/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>Actively involving the public in policy and decision-making. Citizen engagement is a central aim of <a href="terms/open-government/">open government</a>, with the aims of improving decision making and gaining or retaining citizens’ consent and support. Open data is an essential tool for ensuring informed engagement.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Civic Hacking [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/civic-hacking/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>Building tools and communities, usually online, that address particular civic or social problems. Examples could be tools that help users meet like-minded people locally based on particular interests, report broken infrastructure to their local council, or collaborate to clear litter from their neighbourhood. Local-level open data is particularly useful for civic hacking projects.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Cloud [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/cloud/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>Data stored ‘in the cloud’ is handled by a <a href="terms/host/">hosting</a> company, relieving the data owner of the need to manage its physical storage. Instead of being stored on a single machine, it may be stored across or moved between multiple machines in different locations, but the data owner and users do not need to know the details. The hosting company is responsible for keeping it available and accessible via the <a href="terms/internet/">internet</a>.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Connectivity [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/connectivity/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>Connectivity relates to the ability for communities to connect to the Internet, especially the World Wide Web.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Conversion [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/conversion/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>The process of automatically reading data in one <a href="terms/file-format/">file format</a> and emitting the same data in a different format, thus making the data accessible to a wider range of applications.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Copyright [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/copyright/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>A legal right over intellectual property (e.g. a book) belonging to the creator of the work. While individual data (facts) cannot be copyright, a database will in general be covered by copyright protecting the selection and arrangement of data within it. Within the European Union separate ‘<a href="terms/database-rights/">database rights</a>’ protect a database where there was a substantial effort in ‘obtaining’ the data. A copyright holder may use a <a href="terms/licence/">licence</a> to grant other people rights in the protected material, perhaps subject to specified restrictions.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Corruption [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/corruption/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>Misuse of public positions or funds, e.g. by embezzling money, extorting bribes, claiming unreasonable expenses, illicitly favouring friends or particular groups in public services or appointments, etc. Open data and, more generally, <a href="terms/open-government/">open government</a> is an important tool in the fight against corruption.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Cost recovery [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/cost-recovery/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>The principle of setting a price for a resource, e.g. data, aiming to recover the cost of collecting the data, as distinct from <a href="terms/marginal-cost/">marginal cost</a>. Data charged for on a cost-recovery basis is not open data according to the <a href="terms/open-definition/">Open Definition</a>. Studies show that charging for PSI on a cost-recovery basis leads to lower growth than free or marginal-cost pricing.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Creative Commons [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/creative-commons/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>A non-profit organisation founded in 2001 that promotes re-usable content by publishing a number of standard <a href="terms/licence/">licences</a>, some of them open (though others include a <a href="terms/non-commercial/">non-commercial</a> clause), that can be used to release content for <a href="terms/re-use/">re-use</a>, together with clear explanations of their meaning.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  
  
  <dt>Crowdsourcing [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/crowdsourcing/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>Dividing the work of collecting a substantial amount of data into small tasks that can be undertaken by volunteers. Some examples: Wikipedia is a crowd-sourced encyclopedia and Galaxy Zoo was an early example of crowdsourcing scientific data, by asking non-expert volunteers to classify galaxies based on their visual appearance. NOVAM was a service which allowed the public to verify or correct official data on the locations of UK bus stops, crowdsourcing about 18,000 corrections.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>DOI [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/doi/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>Digital Object Identifier, an <a href="terms/identifier/">identifier</a> for a digital object (such as a document or dataset) that is assigned by a central registry and is therefore guaranteed to be a globally unique identifier: no two digital objects in the world will have the same DOI.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  
  
  <dt>Data [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/data/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>Data may be thought of as unprocessed atomic statements of fact. It very often refers to systematic collections of numerical information in tables of numbers such as <a href="terms/spreadsheet/">spreadsheets</a> or <a href="terms/database/">databases</a>. When data is structured and presented so as to be useful and relevant for a particular purpose, it becomes <a href="terms/information/">information</a> available for human apprehension. See also <a href="terms/knowledge/">knowledge</a>.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Data Access Protocol [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/data-access-protocol/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>A system that allows outsiders to be granted access to databases without overloading either system.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Data cleaning [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/data-cleaning/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>Processing a dataset to make it easier to consume. This may involve fixing inconsistencies and errors, removing non-machine-readable elements such as formatting, using standard labels for row and column headings, ensuring that numbers, dates, and other quantities are represented appropriately, <a href="terms/conversion/">conversion</a> to a suitable <a href="terms/file-format/">file format</a>, reconciliation of labels with another dataset being used (see <a href="terms/data-integration/">data integration</a>), etc. See <a href="terms/data-quality/">data quality</a>.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Data collection [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/data-collection/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>Datasets are created by collecting data in different ways: from manual or automatic measurements (e.g. weather data), surveys (census data), records of decisions (budget data) or ongoing transactions (spending data), aggregation of many records (crime data), mathematical modelling (population projections), etc.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Data integration [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/data-integration/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>Almost any interesting use of data will combine data from different sources. To do this it is necessary to ensure that the different datasets are compatible: they must use the same names for the same objects, the same units or co-ordinates, etc. If the <a href="terms/data-quality/">data quality</a> is good this process of data integration may be straightforward but if not it is likely to be arduous. A key aim of <a href="terms/linked-data/">linked data</a> is to make data integration fully or nearly fully automatic. Non-open data is a barrier to data integration, as obtaining the data and establishing the necessary permission to use it is time-consuming and must be done afresh for each dataset.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Data journalism [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/data-journalism/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>The ability to work with data is an increasingly important part of a journalist’s armoury. Skills needed to research and tell a good data-based story include finding relevant data, <a href="terms/data-cleaning/">data cleaning</a>, exploring or mining the data to understand what story it is telling, and creating good <a href="terms/visualisation/">visualisations</a></p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Data leakage [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/data-leakage/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>If personal data has been imperfectly <a href="terms/anonymisation/">anonymised</a>, it may be possible by piecing it together (perhaps with data available from other sources) to reconstruct the identity of some data subjects together with personal data about them. The personal data, which should not have been published (see <a href="terms/data-protection-legislation/">data protection</a> ), may be said to have ‘leaked’ from the ‘anonymised’ data. Other kinds of confidential data can also be subject to leakage by, for example, poor data security measures. See <a href="terms/de-identification/">de-identification</a>.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Data management [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/data-management/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>The policies, procedures, and technical choices used to handle data through its entire lifecycle from <a href="terms/data-collection/">data collection</a> to storage, preservation and use. A data management policy should take account of the needs of <a href="terms/data-quality/">data quality</a>, availability, <a href="terms/data-protection-legislation/">data protection</a>, <a href="terms/data-preservation/">data preservation</a>, etc.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Data portal [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/data-portal/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>A <a href="terms/web/">web</a> platform for publishing data. The aim of a data portal is to provide a data catalogue, making data not only available but <a href="terms/discoverable/">discoverable</a> for data users, while offering a convenient publishing workflow for publishing organisations. Typical features are web interfaces for publishing and for searching and browsing the catalogue, machine interfaces (APIs) to enable automatic publishing from other systems, and data preview and visualisation.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Data preservation [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/data-preservation/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>The Domesday Book of 1086 was written with ink on vellum, a technology that is still legible today. Long-term preservation of present day datasets is more difficult to ensure owing to uncertainty about the future of file formats, computer architectures, storage media and network connectivity. Projects that put particular stress on data preservation take a variety of approaches to solving these problems.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Data protection legislation [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/data-protection-legislation/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>Data protection legislation is not about protecting the data, but about protecting the right of citizens to live without fear that information about their private lives might become public. The law protects <a href="terms/privacy/">privacy</a> (such as information about a person’s economic status, health and political position) and other rights such as the right to freedom of movement and assembly. For example, in Finland a travel card system was used to record all instances when the card was shown to the reader machine on different public transport lines. This raised a debate from the perspective of freedom of movement and the travel card data collection was abandoned based on the data protection legislation.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Data quality [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/data-quality/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>A measure of the useableness of data. An ideal dataset is accurate, complete, timely in publication, consistent in its naming of items and its handling of e.g. missing data, and directly <a href="terms/machine-readable/">machine-readable</a> (see <a href="terms/data-cleaning/">data cleaning</a>), conforms to <a href="terms/standard/">standards</a> of nomenclature in the field, and is published with sufficient <a href="terms/metadata/">metadata</a> that users can easily understand, for example, who it is published by and the meaning of the variables in the dataset.</p>
</dd>
  
  
  
  <dt>Data wrangler [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/data-wrangler/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>A person converting data into a usable form so that they can be easily used with automated or semi-automated tools. Data wrangling may include further <a href="terms/data-cleaning/">data cleaning</a>.</p>

  <dt>Information Asset Register [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/information-asset-register/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>IARs are registers specifically set up to capture and organise meta-data about the vast quantities of information held by government departments and agencies. A comprehensive IAR includes databases, old sets of files, recent electronic files, collections of statistics, research and so forth.</p>

<p>The <a href="terms/eu-psi-directive/">EU PSI Directive</a> recognises the importance of asset registers for prospective re-users of public information. It requires member states to provide lists, portals, or something similar. It states: <em>” Tools that help potential re-users to find documents available for re-use and the conditions for re-use can facilitate considerably the cross-border use of public sector documents. Member States should therefore ensure that practical arrangement are in place that help re-users in their search for documents  available for reuse. Assets lists, accessible preferably online, of main documents (documents that are extensively re-used or that have the potential to be extensively re-used), and portal sites that are linked to decentralised assets lists are example  of such practical arrangements.”</em></p>

<p>IARs can be developed in different ways. Government departments can develop their own IARs and these can be linked to national IARs. IARs can include information which is held by public bodies but which has not yet been – and maybe will not be – proactively published. Hence they allow members of the public to identify information which exists and which can be requested. <em>“For the public to make use of these IARs, it is important that any registers of information held should be as complete as possible in order to be able to have confidence that documents can be found. The incompleteness of some registers is a significant problem as it creates a degree of unreliability which may discourage some from using the registers to search for information.”</em></p>

<p>It is essential that the metadata in the IARs should be comprehensive so that search engines can function effectively. In the spirit of open government data, public bodies should make their IARs available to the general public as raw data under an open license so that civic hackers can make use of the data, for example by building search engines and user interfaces.</p>

Both legal and technical compatibility is vital, and the Open Definition ensures that openly-licensed data can be combined successfully, avoiding a proliferation of licences and terms of use for open data leading to complexity and incompatibility. As governments and organisations jostle to wear the ‘open’ label, the Open Definition ensures that the term does not lose its meaning amid the hype. Today it is the main international standard for open data and open data licences, with an advisory council of senior open data practitioners and can be found at <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">opendefinition.org</a>. The expert-governed licence conformance process and recommendations for conformance have strengthened licences around the world, for example, in the revision of the UK Government’s internationally influential “Open Government Licence”.

  <dt>Proprietary [<a href="/glossary/en/terms/proprietary/">Permalink</a>]</dt>
  <dd><p>(i) Proprietary software is owned by a company which restricts the ways in which it can be used. Users normally need to pay to use the software, cannot read or modify the <a href="terms/source-code/">source code</a>, and cannot copy the software or re-sell it as part of their own product. Common examples include Microsoft Excel and Adobe Acrobat. Non-proprietary software is usually <a href="terms/open-source/">open source</a>.</p>

<p>(ii) A proprietary <a href="terms/file-format/">file format</a> is one that a company owns and controls. Data in this format may need proprietary software to be read reliably. Unlike an <a href="terms/open-format/">open format</a>, the description of the format may be confidential or unpublished, and can be changed by the company at any time. Proprietary software usually reads and saves data in its own proprietary format. For example, different versions of Microsoft Excel use the proprietary XLS and XLSX formats.</p>

A complex query may ask the database to select records according to some criteria, aggregate certain quantities across those records, etc. Many databases accept queries in the specialised language SQL or dialects of it. A web <a href="terms/api/">API</a> allows an <a href="terms/app-application/">app</a> to send queries to a database over the <a href="terms/web/">web</a>.

Research data management (RDM) is an emerging discipline that seeks best practices in handling this. Traditionally the data was kept by researchers and only final research outputs, such as papers analysing the data, would be published. <a href="terms/open-science/">Open science</a> holds that the data should be published, both to increase verifiability of the work and to enable it to be used in other research. The full spirit of open science collaboration demands data publication early in the project, but research culture will need to change appreciably before this becomes widespread.</p>

  <dd><p>The well-known tragedy of the commons occurs when a common resource, such as grazing land, is degraded through over-use. Effectively, users are treating a limited resource as if it were limitless, owing to a poor incentive structure. The economist Michael Heller coined the term ‘tragedy of the anti-commons’ to describe the opposite failure, where poor incentives lead to under-use of an abundant or limitless resource. The case of data which is unpublished or charged for at above <a href="terms/marginal-cost/">marginal cost</a> is a prime example, data being in fact a limitless resource.</p>

  <dd><p>Public transport routes, timetables and <a href="terms/real-time/">real time</a> data are valuable but difficult candidates for open data. Even when they are published, data from different transit authorities and companies may not be available in compatible formats, making it difficult for third parties to provide integrated transport information. Many transport authorities distribute public transport data using the General Transit Feed Specification (<a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/">GTFS</a>) which is maintained by Google.

  <dd><p>(or UID): An <a href="terms/identifier/">identifier</a> for an object which is guaranteed to be different from identifiers of all other objects in a collection. Within a database, every object will have a UID that is unique within the database. A UID assigned by a central registry (such as an ISBN for books, or a <a href="terms/doi/">DOI</a> for data) will be unique for all objects for which it is assigned. The http://… identifiers of <a href="terms/linked-data/">linked data</a> provide a technique for guaranteeing UIDs without a central authority.</p>

  <dd><p>A visual representation of data is often the most compelling way of communicating the data, bringing out its key features, correlations and outliers. Though many tools exist, creating a visualisation for a dataset is not an automatic process, but requires careful attention to the meaning of the variables, the relations between them and the stories inherent in the data, to design a visual representation that lets the message of the data shine through.</p>

  <dd><p>A <a href="terms/standard/">standard</a> specifying the <a href="terms/identifier/">identifiers</a> to be used for a particular collection of objects.
